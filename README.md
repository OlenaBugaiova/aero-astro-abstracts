### Content
The Aeronautics & Astronautics Abstracts dataset includes titles and abstracts of about 493 papers published by AIAA either in the journal of propulsion and power (JPP), or in the journal of thermophysics and heat transfers (JTHT) which were manually retrieved from https://arc.aiaa.org. The task is to build a classifier that is able to distinguish between abstracts and/or titles from each specific technical domain. The challenge lies in that both domains (propulsion, heat transfers) contains vocabulary that overlaps such as (combustion, exchange, thermal, fluid, etcâ€¦) which makes it harder to distinguish which journal it comes from
